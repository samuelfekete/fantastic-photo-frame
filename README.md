# Digital Photo Frame

Software for displaying photos on a screen,
making it look good and easy to update.

The application will display photos that are placed in
a specific directory, selecting one at random and showing 
it for a while. 

To avoid having black strips of screen on the sides, (since
the images can be in any ratio), the pictures are bordered
with a photo-frame style 'card' mount, that will readjust its
window to fit any photo.
